# Gabrieli-CantateDominoCanticumNovum

Lilypond source and rendered scores of _Cantate Dominum canticum novum a 5_ by Andrea Gabrieli, available here and on the [Choral Public Domain Library](https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Cantate_Domino_canticum_novum_a_5_(Andrea_Gabrieli))

A robust, fairly paratactic setting of the first four verses of psalm 96, divided in two parts (two verses each) but not excessively long. Gabrieli stresses the last clause with prominent imitation points on 'terribilis' ("he is to be feared").

As suggested on the 1565 title page, instrumental support or substitution is optional but worth considering.
