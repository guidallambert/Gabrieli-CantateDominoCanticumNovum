# Gabrieli-CantateDominoCanticumNovum
Lilypond

Lilypond source and rendered scores of Cantate Dominum canticum novum a 5 by Andrea Gabrieli, available here and on the [Choral Public Domain Library](https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Cantate_Domino_canticum_novum_a_5_(Andrea_Gabrieli))

A robust, fairly paratactic setting of the first four verses of psalm 96, divided in two parts (two verses each) but not excessively long. Gabrieli stresses the last clause with prominent imitation points on 'terribilis' ("he is to be feared").

Source: Andreae Gabrielis Sacrae Cantiones [â€¦], Liber Primus, published Antonio Gardano, Venice 1565. See the main CPDL page for this publication for more commentary and links to the other motets in the volume.

As suggested on the 1565 title page, instrumental support or substitution is optional but worth considering.
